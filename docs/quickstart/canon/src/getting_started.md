# Getting started

This tutorial shows you how to use the languages Slint supports as the host programming language.

We recommend using [our editor integrations for Slint](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/editors) for following this tutorial.

Slint has application templates you can use to create a project with dependencies already set up that follows recommended best practices.

<!-- C++ -->

## Prerequisites

Before using the template, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++ 20 and to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.21 or newer.

Clone or download template repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-cpp-template memory
cd memory
```

## Configure the project

The `CMakeLists.txt` uses the line `add_executable(my_application src/main.cpp)` to set `src/main.cpp` as the main C++ code file.

Change the content of `src/main.cpp` to the following:

```cpp
{{#include main_initial.cpp:main}}
```

Also in `CMakeLists.txt` the line
`slint_target_sources(my_application ui/appwindow.slint)` is a Slint function used to
add the `appwindow.slint` file to the target.

Change the contents of `ui/appwindow.slint` to the following:

```slint
{{#include appwindow.slint:main_window}}
```

Configure with CMake:

```sh
cmake -B build
```

_Note_: When configuring with CMake, the FetchContent module fetches the source code of Slint via git.
This may take some time when building for the first time, as the process needs to build
the Slint runtime and compiler.

Build with CMake:

```sh
cmake --build build
```

Run the application binary on Linux or macOS:

```sh
./build/my_application
```

Windows:

```sh
build\my_application.exe
```

This opens a window with a green "Hello World" greeting.

If you are stepping through this tutorial on a Windows machine, you can run it with

```sh
my_application
```

<!-- C++ -->

<!-- Node -->

Clone the template with the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-nodejs-template memory
cd memory
```

Install dependencies with npm:

```sh
npm install
```

The `package.json` file references `src/main.js` as the entry point for the application and `src/main.js` references `memory.slint` as the UI file.

Replace the contents of `src/main.js` with the following:

```js
{{#include main_initial.js:main}}
```

The `slint.loadFile` method resolves files from the process's current working directory, so from the `package.json` file's location.

Replace the contents of `ui/appwindow.slint` with the following:

```slint
{{#include memory.slint:main_window}}
```

Run the example with `npm start` and a window appears with the green "Hello World" greeting.

<!-- Rust -->

We recommend using [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io) and [our editor integrations for Slint](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/editors) for following this tutorial.

Slint has an application template you can use to create a project with dependencies already set up that follows recommended best practices.

Before using the template, install `[cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)`:

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
```

Use the template to create a new project with the following command:

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-rust-template --name memory
cd memory
```

Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include main_initial.rs:main}}
```

Run the example with `cargo run` and a window appears with the green "Hello World" greeting.
